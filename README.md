# CS5625 Starter Code

This is the starter code for [CS 5625, Interactive Computer Graphics](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5625/2022sp/), offered at Cornell University in Spring 2022.  It supports all the assignments in this class.

You should make a fork of this repository before you clone it, so that you have your own place to keep your code and coordinate with your partner.

This repository is configured with submodules for several libraries it depends on.  Before you can build it you will need to get the submodules, either by cloning with `--recursive` or by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.

For instructions on how to build this code, see the zeroth assignment, [Devops](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5625/2022sp/assignments/devops.html).
